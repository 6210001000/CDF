# Core Digit Finder 
Core Digit Finder is a recursive digit solving algorithm seeking the singular core digit of any large number. The current record I have been able to achieve was a 480 million digit number with this Python script running locally on a MacBook Pro 2GHz i7 Processor, 8GB 1333 MHz DDR3 Memory and running OS X Mavericks 10.9.5
